# 📊 Pakistan Census Data Analysis (2017)

Welcome to my data analysis project based on Pakistan’s 2017 census! This project was created as part of my data science learning journey using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project explores Pakistan’s district-level census data — including population, literacy rate, internet penetration, density, and more — across all provinces and districts.

The goal is to **uncover patterns** and **highlight key regional differences** using data cleaning, visualizations, and statistical insights.

---

##  Key Features

- Cleaned and standardized raw CSV data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Visualizations: bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, heatmaps
- Summary insights about Pakistan's provinces and districts
- Optional PDF report for easy sharing and presentation

##  Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📒
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` 📊

##  Insights Summary

Here are some key findings from the analysis:

- **Punjab** has the highest number of districts (36).
- **Islamabad** has the highest literacy rate (98%).
- **Balochistan** has the lowest internet penetration.
- **Karachi** shows extremely high population density.
- Some districts show a mismatch between urbanization and internet access.
- Urbanization and literacy are generally higher in southern and central regions.
